# Go Web Application

An application built from the ground up in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language using microservices and a [Redis](https://redis.io/) data store. A work in progress that will eventually become a full featured web app.

## Starting Web App

Navigate to the `server` directory and run the following:
```
$ go build
$ ./server
```
Then navigate to `localhost:8080` in a web browser. `Ctrl+C` to terminate the server.
